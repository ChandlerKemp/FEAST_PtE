The data processing files are meant to be run here as scripts. For example, in order to execute
COGCC_2019_productiondata.py, enter the command

python -m FEAST_Path_To_Equivalence_2019.InputData.RawDataProcessingScripts.COGCC_2019_productiondata

If the script is run without the -m flag, relative imports will fail.
